Most of the current test files only use the default synthesizer. Creatively titled PySynth “A” by the documentation. However, this is not the only synth there is. The documentation, found here: https://mdoege.github.io/PySynth/ has a list of the synthesizers as well as demo audio clips for all of the. I encourage you to check them out. However, most of the other synthesizers require another library called NumPy. It may not be neccessary now, but in order to add an additional sound or two, such as (electric piano, or plucked strings, as described one again by the author), we would need it. Regardless, I will create a couple of tests with the different ones, (once I figure out how to install NumPy. Hopefully it doesn't take me an hour this time.) so you can see the differnce in importing as well as the different sounds (assuming you install it too). The functionality is the same though, so if you change the import statement, you should be able to run every test with every different synthesizer.
